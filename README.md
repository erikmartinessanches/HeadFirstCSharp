# HeadFirstCSharp
Since I have a programming background (mainly with Java and some C++), I've done select examples from chapter 2-7 in "Head First C#" book (3rd edition) and chapters 8-11 from 4th edition (and a bonus chapter on events and delegates) in order get good with C#. Many of the examples in 3rd edition use winforms, which live on in modern .NET 7. However, my primary use of this tech will likely be in .NET Web API type of projects.
